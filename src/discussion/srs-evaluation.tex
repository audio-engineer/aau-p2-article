\section{Software requirements evaluation}\label{sec:software-requirements-evaluation}

This section refers back to Section~\ref{sec:software-requirement-specification} and more specifically
Table~\ref{tab:srs}.

\subsection{Must haves}\label{subsec:must-haves}
% textidote: ignore begin

This section concerns the evaluation of the must-have requirements.
Most must-have requirements are satisfied in the development of the first release of the ChessTeacher project.
This entails the basic chess functionality, the online multiplayer functionality and the chess engine implementation.
They work seamlessly and efficiently and are well integrated into the overall project.

\subsubsection{Applied learning principles}
% textidote: ignore begin

Though most features are well implemented as mentioned above, there are some missing features.
The project is missing some key features regarding the learning principles mentioned in
Section~\ref{sec:learning-methods}.
Key missing features include explanations and interactivity.
As chess as a game is complex, there are too many different positions for it to make sense to hard-code responses for
different positions.
To reach the full potential of the idea, the project needs some form of dynamic language model that is able to interpret
the Stockfish provided feedback, process this information and provide tailored feedback to the user.
This implementation is further discussed in Section~\ref{sec:large-language-model-implementation}.
These key missing features makes for worse initial feedback by the test subjects as further discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:results}.
Even though this is undesired feedback and functionality for the overall potential of a chess learning web
application, the developers are still satisfied with the result.

\subsection{Should haves}\label{subsec:should-haves}
% textidote: ignore begin

This section concerns the evaluation of the should-have requirements.
Once again, most should-have requirements are satisfied in the development of the first release of the ChessTeacher
project.
This entails the implementation of user accounts, user registration and authentication, chat functionality and game
listing.
As before, these all work efficiently and smoothly, as also supported by the user tests.

\subsubsection{Engine feedback in English}
% textidote: ignore begin

However, the english feedback from Stockfish is, as per the first release of the project, hard-coded to be a random
message from a selection of three constructed sentences.
This is due to the same reasons as mentioned in Section~\ref{subsec:must-haves}.
Even though the implementation of the english user feedback is suboptimal, it still functions as desired when accounting
for the time and experience limitations.
