\subsection{Comparative analysis}\label{subsec:comparative-analysis}
% textidote: ignore end

Reference is made to Table~\ref{tab:comparative-analysis} for the differences and similarities in the state-of-the-art
solutions.
Explanations for the services and features can be found under the table.

In the table, it can be observed that OTB chess entails the possibility of the players learning from each other and
players playing multiplayer chess when offline.
This potentially makes it one of the best ways to learn chess offline, whilst being able to play multiplayer and having
interactive learning simultaneously.
It can also be observed that the market gap will not be able to encompass offline users, as it will be an online web
application.
However, in the online section, it is observed that only chess educators and the market gap provide the multiplayer
learning experience to the user.
The downside of knowledgeable educators is that they charge money for their teaching service, why the market gap will be
the only solution that can potentially satisfy all the features in the table.
In the table is not included all the other services that~\url{Lichess.org} and~\url{Chess.com} provide, as that is not
the focus of the report.
