Chess is famously played by two players, where each player takes turns to move their pieces.
Because of this, the game is inherently a multiplayer game.
There are however different types of multiplayer games, and while chess is originally a tabletop game, adapting it to a 
digital platform has an effect on the multiplayer aspect of the game.

\subsection{Types of multiplayer games}\label{subsec:types-of-multiplayer-games}

Multiplayer is a term that has been made popular by the video game industry.
It has its roots in the arcade games and the early home consoles.
The term is used to describe games that are played by more than one player.
But the type of multiplayer games from back then is different from the multiplayer games of today.
Throughout the years, there have been three dominating types of multiplayer games~\cite{multiplayer-types}.

The first type has the players take turns to play the game.
It requires the players to be in the same room and to wait for their turn to play.
This type of game was mostly prevalent in the early days, where people would compete for a higher score.
It can be seen in not only video games, but also in tabletop games like chess.

The second type has two players playing on a split-screen.
It also requires the players to be in the same room, but unlike the first type, they can play at the same time.
Some variations of this multiplayer type allows the players to play on different screens, which is called local 
multiplayer.
This type of game is usually seen in co-op and competitive games, and it can still be seen today, but it is not as 
prevalent as it was in the past.

The third type allows for players to play together over the internet.
This type of multiplayer game is the most prevalent today, and it is the type that is most commonly associated with
multiplayer games.
As the name suggest, it allows for the players to play together over the internet, negating the requirement to be in the
same room as with the previous two types.
This type of multiplayer can often be seen in online chess games.

Therefore, we can conclude that by adapting chess to a digital platform, the type of multiplayer game changes from the
first type to the third type.
This can have a drastic effect of the experience players have when learning and playing chess.
