Chess is a game that has existed for millennia.
It has roots in India as well as China where the first iterations of chess we know today were
invented~\cite{murray1913}.

Nowadays, the chess standard universally known as chess is the iteration of the game called international chess or
western chess, which is also the standard that FIDE, the international chess governing body, uses~\cite{fide2024}.

Most people are familiar with chess, hereby the rules of the game and the look of the board.
Specific notations and additional rules that are not common knowledge will be explained later on
when they become relevant to better understand this report.
