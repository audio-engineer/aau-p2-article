\section{Technology}\label{sec:technology}

Throughout the development of the project, a number of different tools and publicly available packages are used to
help the development process.
These different technologies are chosen based on the team's needs and the requirements of the project.
The following sections will describe the different technologies used in the project.

\subsection{Programming stack}\label{subsec:programming}

As the project is a web application, TypeScript~\cite{typescript} is used as the main programming language.
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, with the main difference being that TypeScript is statically typed, while
JavaScript is dynamically typed.
It can be beneficial in larger projects, as it helps to catch errors during compile-time as opposed to run-time.

The frontend of the project is built with React~\cite{react}, which is a JavaScript and TypeScript library for building
user interfaces.
It is developed and maintained by Meta, and is used by many large companies.
React is focused on mobile applications first and foremost; however, it is also useful for desktop applications, why it
is chosen as the top level UI library.

The backend is built using Node.js~\cite{node.js}, which allows the team to build server-side components using
TypeScript.
Node.js is a popular choice for backend development, as it is fast and scalable.
As well as using React for client-side rendering, Next.js~\cite{next.js} is incorporated to handle the server-side
rendering.
Next.js is a React framework running on top of Node.js, which assists in building the frontend and backend
together.

\subsection{JavaScript libraries}\label{subsec:libraries}

Throughout the project, the team uses a number of different libraries to aid with the mundane tasks of web development.

For example, as the focus was on the learning aspect of the project, the team uses Chess.js~\cite{chess.js} to handle
the chess logic and react-chessboard~\cite{react-chessboard} to display the chessboard.

This saves a lot of time, as chess is a complex game with many rules.

The team also uses Material UI~\cite{mui} (MUI) to style the website, as it is a modern and popular library that
uses Google's design language, Material Design.
MUI is used to create the buttons, text fields, and other components that make up the website.

Lastly, the team uses Chatscope~\cite{chatscope} to create the chat window of the website.
The chat window is an important element of the website, as it allows users to communicate with Stockfish or with each
other.

\subsection{Hosting}\label{subsec:hosting}

Since chess, as previously discussed, is inherently a multiplayer game,
infrastructure is required to accommodate this requirement.
More specifically, online multiplayer games, as the name implies, require some kind of network connection between the
players, which is usually facilitated by the internet.

Therefore, the ChessTeacher application would have to be hosted on the internet.
To complicate issues further, it is determined that the web application will have to consist of multiple separate and
independent components, that will have to be hosted online and communicate with each other over the internet.
Those components include: The front end application, the authentication and match databases, and the Stockfish-powered
processing and analysis application.

There are a number of different hosting providers available that were considered for the front end application.
Amazon Web Services~\cite{aws} is a popular choice, but can be expensive and requires a large time investment.
Instead, Vercel~\cite{vercel} is chosen due to its features, convenience and low pricing.
Furthermore, Vercel is also the vendor that makes~\url{Next.js} the front end framework that is selected,
so it is also convenient to pick a hosting provider that features out-of-the-box support for the framework in use.

For the authentication and database, the group uses Firebase~\cite{firebase}.
The main reason for this decision is that Firebase allows for easy authentication using Google accounts, which is
convenient to use and essential for building the multiplayer system that requires some form of authentication,
i.e., unique player identities.
Additionally, Firebase features a real time database service, which is a NoSQL database and WebSocket server in one.
Such a service is a crucial building stone for a real time multiplayer application like our proposed solution, because
it facilitates real time exchange of state and other data between the client front end applications.
To conclude, Firebase is chosen because it provides a lot of the features that are required to create an application
like the solution in question.

And lastly, the Stockfish service needs to be hosted as well, but its design comes with a whole new set of challenges.
Stockfish, being a C++ application, can't easily be hosted on the internet.
An intermediate REST API is therefore written and containerized, to prepare Stockfish for deployment.
For the final containerized Stockfish application, the group uses Google Cloud Run~\cite{google-cloud-run} as the
hosting provider, since it features easy and relatively low-cost deployment options for container applications.
