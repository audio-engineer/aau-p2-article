The project requires a number of different services to be running at the same time, which can be difficult to manage.

To manage them, the team uses Docker~\cite{docker} to simultaneously run all the services.
Docker is a platform that allows developers to isolate their applications in containers, which are lightweight and can
run on any machine.
This makes it painless to develop multiservice projects, as there are no compatibility issues between the different
devices and services.
To handle multiple containers, the team uses Docker Compose, which is a tool for defining and running multi-container
Docker applications.

As the previous project, the team uses GitHub~\cite{github} for version control.
GitHub provides many features, such as pull requests, issues, and actions, which makes it easy to collaborate and work
on the project.
The team made use of GitHub projects to plan out different tasks, issues to track bugs and features, and pull requests
to review and merge code.
GitHub Actions were also used to test or compile the program automatically.
