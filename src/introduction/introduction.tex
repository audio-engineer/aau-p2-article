Learning is something we do every day.
It is something most people enjoy and strive to experience.
However, learning can also be difficult.
In this report we will explore the concept of collaborated assisted learning and how software can assist in this method.
We will be focusing our analysis around the age-old game of chess.

AI and chess engine popularity has risen greatly in the past years and have been developed to a point that they
outperform humans.
These tools are essential to understanding the complexity of the end- and mid-game strategies of chess.
Chess encapsulates the spirit of a game that is easy to learn, but hard to master.
We will be focusing on the learning part by efficiently and strategically teaching beginners the rules and common
strategies of the game using the capabilities of available chess engines.
