\abstract{This project aims to facilitate learning of the game chess by replacing the traditional coach with a
chess engine.
The key focus points of the report are the learning aspect of chess, primarily focusing on why assisted
learning, such as coaching, is more effective than individual learning.
The outcome is an online multiplayer game called ChessTeacher, where two people can play against each other, while
receiving coaching from a chess engine in the form of feedback on the players' moves, and suggest improvements.
The results the authors found during this project indicate that using chess engines for coaching is viable, but it is
lacking in terms of communicating with the players.
A promising addition to chess engine coaching is LLMs, as they could make up for chess engines'
lack of communication skills.
This would help mitigate the biggest issue the test users found while testing the app.}
