\section{Software requirement specification}\label{sec:software-requirement-specification}

To answer to problem statement, an outline of the desired program features is made.
The method of choice for the requirement specifications is the MoSCoW model~\cite{hudaib2018}.
The overview of the features the application will and will not entail are provided in Table~\ref{tab:srs}.
In the table, the MoSCoW categories have the following meaning:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{``Must-haves''} (Mo) encapsulates all the features that must be
    included in the final product.
    \item \textbf{``Should-haves''} (S) encapsulates features that are desired and that we are technically able to
    implement if not for the time constraints of the project.
    \item \textbf{``Could-haves''} (Co) encapsulates features that are possible
    to implement but are not the focus of this report.
    \item \textbf{``Won't-haves''} (W) encapsulates out of scope features that are not going to be considered nor
    implemented.
\end{itemize}
