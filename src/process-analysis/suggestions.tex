Suggestions for future projects include making group work more evenly distributed.
By controlling the scope of the project, all group members can contribute more easily, reducing workload imbalance and
improving efficiency.
Additionally, the group could probably have benefited from more frequent meetings, where the group could discuss the
progress of the project and any issues that arose.
This would have helped to ensure that everyone was on the same page and that the
project was moving in the right direction.
Another issue the group encountered was with the problem statement, which was not specific enough.

The group had a hard time trying to figure out what the scope of the problem statement was which had
an impact on the work that was done and created this workload imbalance.
