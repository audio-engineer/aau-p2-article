The group has taken feedback from the previous process analysis and is confident that they've improved their teamwork
since P1.
However, there are still some areas that could be improved, but they are far fewer than in the previous project.
Furthermore, the group has learned a lot of new tools that could be used in future projects.
Therefore, they are satisfied with the work they have done in this project.
